Includes prompt photons and thermal photons
Thermal photons are either from the "pre-equilibrium phase" (KoMPoST) or the hydrodynamics phase (hydro)

Regarding prompt photons, keep in mind that they very likely have a considerable uncertainty at low p_T
(current prompt photon calculation possibly not very reliable below 1-1.5 GeV)

The first column of every file is the transverse momentum (p_T) in GeV
The second column is 1/(2*pi*p_T) dN/(dp_T*dy) at rapidity y=0, in GeV^-2
Third to eighth columns is the v_1{SP}, v_2{SP}, v_3{SP}, ...
